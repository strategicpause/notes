* **What are TLB shootdowns (TLB)?** A TLB is a Transition Lookaside Buffer which is a cache of translations from a virtual memory address to a physical memory address. When a virtual-to-physical mapping changes for a processor, it must tell other processors to to invalidate their mappings - this is a TLB shootdown.
* **What causes a TLB shootdown?** 
* **What are Function call interrupts (CAL)?** 
    * This interrupt is generated by the kernel when it needs to call a specific function or service.
    * Instructions that trigger software-interrupts to implement system calls.


* **What are rescheduling interrupts (RES)?** 
	* Generated by the kerenel wheen it needs to reschedule a process or thread to run on a different CPU core.
* **What are local timer interrupts (LOC)?** 
	* Generated by th local timer on each CPU core. Used by the kernel for scheduling purposes and to track the time lapsed since system boot.
* **What is the TIMER soft IRQ?** 
    * Used for timer management such as scheduling periodic tasks or triggering events after a certain amount of time has elapsed.
* **What is the NET_TX soft IRQ?** 
    * Used for network packet transmission such as sending data over a NIC.
* **What is the NET_RX soft IRQ?** 
    * Used for neetwork packet reception, such as processing incoming data from a network interface card.
* **What is the TASKLET soft IRQ?**
	* Used for task scheduling, such as scheduling work to be done in respons to an event or interrupt.
* **What is the SCHED soft IRQ?** 
	* Used for task scheduling as well, but is usd for higher-priority scheduling activities.
* **What is the RCU soft IRQ?** 
	* Used for sycnchronization between multiple threads or processes that access shared data. It ensures that shared data is not modified by one thread while another thread is reading it.

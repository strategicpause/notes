### Notes
* PARSEC (Princeton Application Repository for Shared-Memory Computers) is a collection of parallel programs which can be used for performance studies of multiprocessor machines.
* Building the benchmark suite can take between 30-60 minutes.
* Running `parsecmgmt -a run` will verify all benchmarks have been built successfully and are executable. It is not meant to be used a performance measurement.

* Basic Statistics
	* Arithmetic Mean
		* Average. Sum up all of your values in a data set and divide the sum by the number of values.
	* Standard Deviation.
		* Quantifies the amount of variation or disperson in a data set of values.
		* Indicates how much the indiivudal data points in a dataset difer from the mean.
		* A low standard deviation indicates that data points are close to the mean, indicating low variability.
		* A high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range, indicating high variability.
	* Coefficient of Varation.
		* Standardized measure of the disperson of a probability distrituin or frequency distribution.
		* Used to compare the relative variability of data sets that have different units or widely different means.
		* Calculated as the (std dev) / (mean) * 100%.
		* Useful for comparing the degree of variation from one data series to another. Even the means are drasticially different.
		* A CV of 5% indicates the std deviation if 5% of the mean.
		* It is a unitless measure which makes it useful for comparing datasets with different units or scales.
		* High CV - Indicates high variability relative to the mean suggesting the data points are spread aout over a wide range.
		* Low CV - Indicates low variability relative to the mean suggesting the data points are closely clustered around the mean.

* Statistical Tests
	* Independent Samples t-test (Two-Sample t-test)
		* Used to compare the means of two independent groups to see if they are significantly different from each other.
		* 

* What is an inferential statistic?
	* Help you come to conclusions and make predictions based on data.
	* Two main uses:
		* Making estimates about populations.
		* Testing hypotheses to draw conclusions about populations.
* What is a T-Test?
	* Also referred to as a student's t-test.
	* An inferential statistic to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups and how they are related.
	* Compares the average values of two data sets and determines if they came from the same population.
	* Used when the data sets follow a normal distribution and have known variances.
	* Used for hypothesis testing in statistics.
	* Produces two values
		* t-value
			* Ratio of the difference between the mean of the two sample sets and the variation that exists within the sample sets.
			* Higher values indicate that a large difference exists between the two sample sets.
			* Smaller values indicate similarity between the two sample sets.
		* degress of freedom
			* Refers to the values in a study that has the freedom to vary and are essential for assessing the importance of the validity of the null hypothesis.
* What is a Mann-Whitney U Test?
	* A non-parametric alternative test used to compare two sample means that come from the same population.
	* Used to test if two sample means are equal or not.
	* Used when the data is ordinal or the assumptions of the t-test are not met.
	* Results are presented in group rank differences rather than group mean differences.
* What is Ordinal?
	* Data which is classified into categories within a varialbe that have a natural rank order.
* What is a z-test?
	* A statistical test used to determine whether two population means are different when the variances are known and the sample size is large.
	* Used to compare on mean to a hypothesized value.
	* Data must approximately fit a normal distribution.
* What are Type I and II errors?
	* Type I
		*  Rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of a false alternative.
	* Type II
		* Failing to reject a false null hypothesis in favor of a true alternative hypothesis.
* What is power?
	* The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when, in fact, it is false.
	* The probability of making a correct decision when the null hypothesis is false.
	* The probability that a test of signifcance will pick uup on an effect that is present.
	* The probability that a test of significance will detect a deviation from the null hypothesis, should a deviation exist.
	* The probability of avoiding a type II error.
	* Power is increased when a sample size is increased.
* What is a  significance level?
	* Referred to as a alpha. 
	* This is the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis and is often set at 0.05 or 0.01. 
	* If we assume the null hypothesis is true, what is the probability of getting a sample with the statistics that we get? If the probabability is less than the alpha value, then we reject the null hypothesis.
	* It represents the risk of commiting a Type 1 error (rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of a false alternative.
* What is a p-value?
	* Stands for probability value. The probability of getting a statistic 
	* Probability that a sample mean is <= some value that the null hypothesis is true.
	* 
* What is the effect size?
	* Indicates how large or meaningful the effect is, which is used to help interpret results.
* How do you conduct a power analysis?
	* Determine the significance level. Typically 0.05 or 0.01.
